    "chris miller Lab4, not working as intended will specify in the git log.txt
- the reading of the input file works as intended, along with adding the objects into the hashset, every object has a parent object and an array of children objects.
- with the run method, i ran into some problems, the display works as intended, turning on works however the current does not update properly with the circuits but there is a relation when turning on and off a child component but i did not have time to trouble shoot it. turning on also does not overload the circuit becase it is not implemente correctly. pluging and unpluging i did nto have time to complete and wanted to focus more on the core structure.
- turning off a component will turn off that component, but not the children, did didnt have time to implent it correctly
overall most of the methods work mostly, hopefully you can follow my code to see my process however i did not comment heavely becasue i was more focused on geting it to work."
