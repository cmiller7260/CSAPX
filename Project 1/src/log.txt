    "Chris Miller project 1: project one takes two files as input and
    compares them based on the patern, tag - text with text including a space
    to allow for an open tag open tag. multiple spaces are treated as a single space
    and all whitespace charicters are treated the same. if the tag is a break the
    program will continue to the next tag however if the tags do not match in both files
    the program will continue each file searching for the next closing tag ie the inner most tag
    had some trouble with the line the error was on becasue of processing the new line befroe comparing the two objects,
    however i beleave it was a simple off by one error and that it should work for all files, ie i worked for all the test files."
